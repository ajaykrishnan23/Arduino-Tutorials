# Arduino-Tutorials
Problems to help understand basic Arduino concepts

## Prerequisites
You will have to install the official Arduino IDE.
You can install the IDE through the official website. See: [Installing Arduino IDE](https://startingelectronics.org/software/arduino/installing-arduino-software-windows-10/)

## *Project Descriptions*

1. Choosing the led based on the intensity of light falling on the LDR.
2. Controlling the rotation of a servo motor through a potentiometer.
3. Choosing the led to blink depending the datatype given through Serial Input.
4. Varying led delay accoring to user inputs and displaying the delay at every fixed intervals.
5. Choosing an led out of 3 using two push buttons.
6. Displaying 3 bit binary values through leds and a push button.
7. Recording and displaying an led blink sequence through two push buttons - one for toggle modes and one for recording.
